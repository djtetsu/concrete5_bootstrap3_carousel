concrete5_bootstrap3_carousel
=============================

A Bootstrap 3 compatible carousel Concrete5 CMS Block

A very quick and basic Concrete5 building block that enables you to build a Bootstrap 3 Carousel.

This block can be installed by copying the bootstrap3_carousel folder into your Concrete5 blocks folder (the one at root level of your install).

Then you just need to install it via the Blocks section in the Concrete5 dashboard and you should then be able to add this block to your pages.

It's quite basic and could do with some work to make it a bit more customisable.

Oh yeah, you'll also need to have Bootstrap 3 (and any Bootstrap 3 dependencies) included in your Concrete5 theme/templates otherwise this isn't going to work all that well for you.
